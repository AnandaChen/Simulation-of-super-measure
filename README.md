The codes and pics of simulation of "Euler simulation of interacting particle systems and McKean-Vlasov SDEs with fully superlinear growth drifts in space and interaction", paper link on arXiv:   arxiv.org/abs/2208.12772

We use pytorch to run the code on gpu, we suggest to use google colab to aviod issues.

Please email to X.Chen-176@sms.ed.ac.uk if you have any question, thank you.
